<h1>Bitcoin Closing Price Graph Visualizer</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project visualizes the historical closing price of Bitcoin from January 1, 2022, to the current date using an animated line graph. It downloads Bitcoin data from Yahoo Finance, processes the data to handle potential multi-index column issues, and creates a smooth animation that illustrates Bitcoin's price fluctuations over time.

<br>
<br>

The animation is generated with Python's Matplotlib library and saved as an MP4 video using FFmpeg. This project demonstrates practical applications of data acquisition, data manipulation, and dynamic data visualization, making it a useful tool for understanding trends in cryptocurrency markets.
